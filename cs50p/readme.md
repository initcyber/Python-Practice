# CS50P Python Practice Repository

This is simply a repository containing all of the practice files for CS50P located here:

https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/


# Organization of files

Each of these files will be organized by Weeks and (hopefully) in folders by their project "types" (whether its a calculator, working on Conditionals, Loops, "Hello World", etc.). This is also a repository where I practice using git commands both in CLI and using VSCode to create branches for each week, practice pushing smaller commits as I make changes, and after each "Week" is done, create a *pull* request in GitHub to *merge* the branches together into **Main**. So far this has been a fun and rewarding project with more to come.
